# clock

use stm32F429igt chip, 7 inch lcd screen and esp8266, make it display time.
device as server open 80 port, listen clien send time to sync.
but because esp8266-01 is not quite stable, so maybe you need restart device to build tcp server.
also you can choose a picture and put it into sd card to display on screen as background.
